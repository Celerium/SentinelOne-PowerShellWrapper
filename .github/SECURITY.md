## Our security policy and Your responsibility

- **POLICY**:

*Our security policy is to avoid leaving the ecosystem worse than we found it. Meaning we are not planning to introduce vulnerabilities into the ecosystem.*

The "SentinelOneAPI" team and community take all security bugs in "SentinelOneAPI" seriously. Thank you for improving the security of "SentinelOneAPI". We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

Report security bugs by emailing the lead maintainer at [celerium@celerium.org] and include the word "SECURITY" in the subject line..

The lead maintainer will acknowledge your email within a week, and will send a more detailed response 48 hours after that indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will endeavor to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

- "SentinelOneAPI" will confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
